Machine learning problem can be categrized into to types: 
⋅⋅*Regression Problem. (i.e. linear regression)
⋅⋅*Classification Problem. (i.e. distinguish cancer positive or negative from tumour attributes)

And depend on whether the training set is provided, the problem can again be classified as:
..*Supervised learning (with training set beforehand)
..*Unsupervised learning. (online learning, no training set beforehand)

Here is a hands-on Python code example for
##Logistic Regression
