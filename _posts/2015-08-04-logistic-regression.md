###All you have to know about machine learning:

Machine learning problem can be categrized into two types: 

- *Regression Problem*.   (i.e. linear regression)
- *Classification Problem*.   (i.e. distinguish cancer positive or negative from tumour attributes)

And depend on whether the training set is provided, the problem can again be classified as:

- *Supervised learning*.   (with training set beforehand)
- *Unsupervised learning*.   (online learning, no training set beforehand)

###Hands-on experiments while taking course from [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)

Here is a hands-on Python code example for [**Logistic Regression**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression).

Logistic regression is a classification problem with supervised learning.
