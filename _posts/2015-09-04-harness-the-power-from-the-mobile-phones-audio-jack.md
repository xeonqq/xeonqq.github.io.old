Inspired by the [paper](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~prabal/pubs/papers/kuo10hijack-islped.pdf) on "Hijacking Power and Bandwidth from the Mobile Phoneâ€™s Audio Interface". I decided to try it out and see if it is powerful enough to power my Leonardo Arduino.

##Schematics and PCB design

###PCB

Tips I got from experienced PCB designer:

- The thickness of traces: A good value is everything greater than or equal to 16mil (0.4mm)

- The spacing/isolation between the polygons (filling) and the wires: A good value is 20mil (0.5mm). The parameter usually is called "isolation", "spacing" or "clearance". Please do that with the fillings on both layers.

- Generate thermals for vias" or anything like that. When added thermals however, small "cutouts" are created around the hole which prevent the heat from "flowing away". 


##Solder the components on the PCB
I got the etched PCB from university's lab. I still need to place the components like mos-fet, diode and mini-transformers. Because these components are SMDs, Soldering paste has to be applied first on the pads before you actully place the components on it. After that, the PCB is sent to a reflow oven to be "cooked".
